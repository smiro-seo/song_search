<p>As if there was any other choice for number 1 on this list! &#8220;Purple Rain &#8221;lends its title to an album and movie that only artists like Prince have the audacity and vision to create.</p>
<p>As Prince and his band performed during the 2010 Super Bowl halftime show, the skies opened as they played &#8220;Purple Rain &#8221;in the rain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Purple Rain &#8221;is about being in the end times or judgment day with those you love, letting God guide you through the Purple Rain, as blue skies mix with blood turning the sky purple.</p>
<p>The guitars are fabulously chorused 80s style and &#8220;Purple Rain &#8221;features one of Prince &#8217;s legendary moments of guitar heroics on one of his brilliant songs. On your next long rainy drive, warm up those vocal cords and let Prince guide you through the Purple Rain.&nbsp;</p>
